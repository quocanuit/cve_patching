# CI/CD PIPELINE FOR AUTOMATING WINDOWS SECURITY PATCHING

## Overview

Manual Windows security patching creates significant risks: delayed remediation, human errors, inconsistent documentation, and poor scalability. Our solution provides a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that intelligently processes vulnerability reports and executes patches using AI-driven decision-making.

**Key Benefits:**
- AI-enhanced patching decisions using Amazon SageMaker
- Failure intelligence via Amazon Bedrock for log analysis and recommendations
- End-to-end traceability with comprehensive logging
- Event-driven automation requiring zero manual intervention

### Workflow Stages

1. **Input**: Security team uploads CSV vulnerability report to S3
2. **Trigger**: S3 event automatically triggers Lambda â†’ Jenkins pipeline
3. **Filter**: AWS Glue processes CSV, filtering Critical/High severity CVEs
4. **Classify**: Amazon Bedrock classifies unknown severity CVEs using LLM
5. **Predict**: SageMaker predicts patch duration and success probability
6. **Execute**: AWS Systems Manager runs PowerShell patches on Windows servers
7. **Analyze**: Bedrock analyzes patch logs and provides failure recommendations
8. **Report**: Summary emailed to security team with results and insights
